			<p>Reading is fundamental to functioning in today's society. 
				There are many adults who cannot read well enough to understand 
				the instructions on a medicine bottle. That is a scary thought - especially 
				for their children. Filling out applications becomes impossible without 
				help. Reading road or warning signs is difficult. Even following a map 
				becomes a chore. Day-to-day activities that many people take for granted 
				become a source of frustration, anger and fear.
			</p>
			<p>
				Reading is a vital skill in finding a good job. Many well-paying jobs 
				require reading as a part of job performance. There are reports and memos 
				which must be read and responded to. Poor reading skills increases the 
				amount of time it takes to absorb and react in the workplace. A person 
				is limited in what they can accomplish without good reading and comprehension 
				skills.
